    Terrestrial animals are animals that live predominantly or entirely on land (e.g. cats, ants,spiders), 
    as compared with aquatic animals, which live predominantly or entirely in the water (e.g. fish, lobsters, octopuses), 
    and amphibians, which rely on a combination of aquatic and terrestrial habitats</pre>

        <br>Dolphins have smooth skin, flippers, and a dorsal fin. They have a long, slender snout with about 100 teeth,
        and a streamlined body. The single blowhole on top of their head has a flap that opens to reveal a pair of
        nostrils, which dolphins use for breathing when they surface.
